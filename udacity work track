40 days Completed # 60days of udacity:
20 days more to go to. 

*applied filters on images for edge detection.
*Learnt about CNNs and implemented it on CIFAR-10. got 75% test accuracy.Will improve it through image augmentation. 
*Implemenetd style transfer through VGG Network,
*Started learning about character predictions through RNNs.
